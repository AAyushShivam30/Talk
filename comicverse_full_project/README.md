# ComicVerse Hub — Static Site

Drop the files into a folder structured like:

```
/index.html
/browse.html
/comic-detail.html
/cart.html
/assets/css/style.css
/assets/js/comics.js
/assets/js/main.js
/assets/img/*
```

Open `index.html` in the browser or deploy to GitHub Pages.

Replace the images in `assets/img/` with your own. The `COMICS` array in `assets/js/comics.js` is the single data source.
